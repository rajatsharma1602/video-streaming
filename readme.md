# aim
  create a backend service to stream videos for a start

# approach to this project so far
  node server providing an api to call to stream a particular video

# how to use this
  - clone this repo
  - npm install
  - make sure you have nodemon installed globally, as it's useful in every node project,
    if not run following command in your terminal
      `npm i -g nodemon`
  - in this project folder run
      `npm ci`
      or `npm i` in case you do not have npm version >=6.2.0
  - run command
      `nodemon`
  - visit localhost:8090 in your browser and you are good to go

# the 2 approaches to play video
  - streamed
  - unstreamed

    well if you have been using node js for a while you may know the difference between streamed and unstreamed data.
    to checkout the real magic checkout the network tab in your browser (hope so you know how to find this as well ;) )
